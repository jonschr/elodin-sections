# Red Blue Sections
Red Blue Sections extends Advanced custom fields for Genesis themes. It sets up a new page template for this purpose, registers the necessary fields, and sets up basic layouts for some commonly-used sections.

*This plugin requires the Advanced Custom Fields Pro plugin, and the Genesis framework. Without both of these installed and active, it probably won't do anything.*

## Style-ready classes
A few classes have ben set up by default to allow for more flexibility for sections. These can be added at the bottom of each section.

### For use on all sections ###
- **align-center** – aligns everything inside the section to center on desktop and tablet, but left-aligns it on mobile
- **full-height** – makes the section full-height on desktop (100% of the height of the browser viewport).
