# About redblue-sections
A plugin which extends Advanced custom fields for Genesis themes. It sets up a new page template for this purpose, registers the necessary fields, and sets up basic layouts for some commonly-used sections.

# Style-ready classes
A few classes have ben set up by default to allow for more flexibility for sections.

## For use on all sections ##
- *align-center* – aligns everything inside the section to center on desktop and tablet, but left-aligns it on mobile
- *full-height* – makes the section full-height on desktop (100% of the height of the browser viewport).
